# Portfolio Optimization Project

This repository contains an Excel file with a comprehensive analysis of portfolio optimization strategies. The project involves analyzing monthly returns data for seven major stocks from January 1, 2012 to January 4, 2016, and performing various optimization techniques.

## Contents

The Excel file in this repository contains four sheets with the following analyses:

1. **Minimum Risk Portfolio**: Analysis of minimizing portfolio risk subject to a minimum return level of 0.012.
2. **Efficient Frontier (Risk Minimization)**: Table and graph showing the efficient frontier when minimizing risk for various return levels.
3. **Maximum Return Portfolio**: Analysis of maximizing expected return subject to a risk ceiling of 0.0016.
4. **Efficient Frontier (Return Maximization)**: Table and graph showing the efficient frontier when maximizing return for various risk levels.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is monthly returns data from Yahoo Finance, using Adjusted Close prices for the following stocks:

- GM (General Motors)
- C (Citigroup, Inc.)
- WMT (Wal-Mart)
- PFE (Pfizer)
- GE (General Electric)
- MS (Morgan Stanley)
- PEP (Pepsico)

## Project Scope

The Excel file provides detailed analysis and solutions for:

a. Optimizing the portfolio for a return floor of 0.012, showing optimal risk and largest stock portion.
b. Constructing a table and graph of the efficient frontier (risk minimization approach).
c. Optimizing the portfolio for a risk ceiling of 0.0016, showing optimal return and largest stock portion.
d. Constructing a table and graph of the efficient frontier (return maximization approach).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the Excel file.
2. Open the Excel file to view the analyses on each sheet.
3. Each sheet contains detailed calculations, results, and visualizations for the respective parts of the project.

## Note

This repository demonstrates portfolio optimization techniques using real market data. The analyses provided should not be considered as financial advice but as an educational exploration of optimization methods in finance.
